# ðŸ“˜ Learning Notes: Concepts, Commands, and Clarity from the 120-Day AWS Journey

This document captures key learnings, insights, and memorable technical concepts I (Devendar) encountered throughout my 120-day AWS learning journey.

---

## ðŸ“… [Day 1] Sankalpa & Setup

- Understood the importance of setting clear, measurable goals (â‚¹18 LPA, SAA-C03 certification, real projects).
- Learned GitHub basics:
  - Creating a repository
  - Writing a meaningful `README.md`
  - Structuring folders by week/day for clarity

---

## ðŸ“… [Day 2] IAM + EC2 Intro

- IAM is used to securely control access to AWS services and resources.
- Created an IAM user with Admin permissions and enabled MFA.
- Learned how to:
  - Generate Access Key ID and Secret
  - Use `aws configure` to set up AWS CLI
  - Verify CLI setup using `aws sts get-caller-identity`
- IAM is a **global** service, unlike regional ones like EC2 or S3.
- Discovered that you can log in via **IAM user** using an **Account Alias**.

## ðŸ“… [Day 3] S3 Static Website Hosting (Manual)

- Created an S3 bucket in ap-south-1 and learned region-specific limitations.
- Enabled Static Website Hosting.
- Understood:
  - Buckets are globally unique.
  - Public access must be explicitly enabled.
  - Website is accessed via the bucketâ€™s endpoint.

---

## ðŸ“… [Day 4] Apache Server on EC2 (Manual)

- Launched an EC2 instance, opened ports 22 and 80 in the security group.
- Connected via SSH using `.pem` key.
- Installed Apache and hosted a static website.
- Learned:
  - What is an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)?
  - Role of ports and security groups
  - Use of `systemctl`, `apt`, `sudo`, `tee`, and `index.html`
- Realized that launching an instance automatically starts it.

---

## ðŸ“… [Day 5] Linux + Git + GitHub via CLI

- Understood `.pem` (Privacy Enhanced Mail) used by AWS vs `.pub` (public key) for GitHub.
- Key Types:
  - RSA (used for EC2)
  - ED25519 (used for GitHub)
- Generated SSH key with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519` for GitHub.
- Added key to GitHub and connected via `ssh -T git@github.com`.
- Learned Git basics:
  - `git init`, `add`, `commit`, `remote`, `push`
  - `git branch -M main` to align local with remote branch
  - `.git` folder stores local repo metadata
- Realized that changes sit in **staging area** after `git add`, and only move to history after `git commit`.
- Learned how to push from CLI by resolving "unrelated histories" error through merging branches and switching to `main`.
- Understood how to debug and correct SSH key errors.
- Captured GitHub CLI workflow using dedicated repo folder (`aws-cli-test`).

---

## ðŸ“… [Day 6] Assessment + EIP + Review + Practice

- Revised all key concepts from IAM, EC2, S3, Git.
- Understood Elastic IP:
  - Public IP changes every restart.
  - EIP provides static IP.
  - Charges apply only if EIP is unassociated while allocated.
  - Can allocate, associate, disassociate, release via CLI or Console.
- Scored ~4/5 in assessment with partial answers.
- Realized GitHub, CLI, S3 concepts are getting stronger.

## ðŸ“… [Day 7] Project 1 Completion + Resume/Profile V1

- Completed Project 1: Static Website Hosting with S3
- Created project folder under projects/project1-static-s3
- Added README, screenshot, bucket policy, website config.
- Created Resume V1:
  - Honest + strategic
  - No fake experience
  - 18 LPA goal highlighted
  - Amazon roles mapped to data/cloud context
- Added week01 summary, debug_notes.md, learning_notes.md, and README.md files.


## ðŸ“… [Day 16] DynamoDB Basics - CRUD operations
- DynamoDB reserved keywords (like status, name, etc.) must be aliased using ExpressionAttributeNames.
- Indentation in Python is strict â€” even one space can cause syntax errors.
- Lambda Deployment Delay: After updating code, ensure it is fully deployed before re-testing.
- Partition Key = Primary Key when only one key is defined (e.g., taskId).

## âœ¨ More learnings will be added as I go deeper into AWS, DevOps, and cloud project building.

Stay tuned. This file will help me quickly revise and reinforce everything when needed.
