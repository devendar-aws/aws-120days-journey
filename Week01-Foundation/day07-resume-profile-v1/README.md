## 🧭 Reflection

> “Every resume is a weapon, and every project is your proof.”  
Today was the **bridge** between my learning and real-world positioning. I now have a working project, CLI expertise, GitHub visibility, and a resume that doesn’t hide — it **speaks** truthfully and strategically for 18 LPA goals.
