# 🚀 AWS 120-Day Warrior Journey

**📅 Start Date:** July 6, 2025  
**🎯 End Date:** November 3, 2025  
**🏆 Goal:** Skill-based ₹18 LPA AWS/Cloud/DevOps job — no shortcuts, only truth and skill.

This is my **120-day public transformation challenge** — from foundational AWS learning to real-world DevOps project deployment. Every day, I document what I learn, build, and understand — with the goal of earning an 18 LPA job **based on real skill and effort**, not fake title mapping.

---

## 🔥 Day 1: Sankalpa + Setup

- ✅ Created this GitHub repo to track AWS progress publicly
- ✅ Reset roadmap, wiped all past content, and started fresh
- ✅ Designed full 120-day plan: themes, weeks, projects, checkpoints
- ✅ Took Sankalpa (spiritual vow) for truth, effort, and transformation

> ### 🧘‍♂️ My Sankalpa:
> *"I will earn an 18 LPA job within 120 days through skills, sincerity, and effort. No shortcuts. No title mapping. Only truth and growth."*
