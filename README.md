# AWS 120-Day Warrior Plan 🚀

**Start Date:** July 6, 2025  
**Goal:** Skill-based ₹18 LPA AWS/Cloud/DevOps Job by November 3, 2025

This repository is a 120-day public log of my AWS journey — from zero to real-world cloud skills. I'm building 5–8 authentic projects, preparing for the SAA-C03 certification, and applying for real jobs — without fake title mapping or shortcuts.

## 🔥 Day 1: Sankalpa + Setup

- Created this GitHub repo to track my AWS learning publicly.
- Set clear 120-day goals with a strict, skill-first agenda.
- Removed old mapped content and committed to honesty in resume and projects.
- Designed the entire roadmap with weekly milestones, projects, and checkpoints.

> **My Sankalpa (Vow):**  
> *"I will earn an 18 LPA job within 120 days through skills, sincerity, and effort. No shortcuts. No title mapping. Only truth and growth."*
