## ✍️ Reflections

- Today marks a **true restart**, not just in learning, but in **integrity**.
- There is no fallback now. I'm not mapping anything fake.
- The Sankalpa gives this journey **sacred discipline**, not just ambition.
- I'm ready to build, learn, and earn every rupee of the ₹18 LPA offer I deserve.

Restart every day by sunrise. No guilt, only bounce-back.
